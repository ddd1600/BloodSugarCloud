Created with the encouragement of my friend in medical school to track my blood glucose data. The original purpose of tracking my blood sugars was in preparation for getting my Third Class Medical Airman's certificate as a type 1 diabetic. I am still working towards that goal, but encourage anyone out there with diabetes to used cloud based services such as this one to keep a close eye on their blood glucose data. The benefits to tracking my data using tools like this have been undeniable.

This application is available for free to anyone to use.

Shoot for the stars, hit the moon. But before you take off, check that blood sugar!
