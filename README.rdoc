Rails based data visualization and blood sugar tracking application. Can import CSV data generated by the OneTouch iOS/Android application and this free application's use is encouraged with this app. Blood sugar data can also be manually entered through the website. Various and sundry graphs are available to visualize trends in the data. CSV export function available to download all of a user's readings and is strongly encouraged.

Created with the encouragement of my friend in medical school to track my blood glucose data. The impetus for creating this application was in order to better track my glucose levels in preparation for obtaining my Third Class Medical Airman's certificate as a type 1 diabetic. I am still working towards that goal, but encourage anyone out there with diabetes to use cloud based data visualization services such as this one to keep a close eye on their blood glucose data. The benefits to tracking my data using tools like this have been undeniable.

This application is available for free to anyone to use. If you'd like to use my server, you're welcome to do so at the colloquially named bloodsugarcloud.com. Though I have no intentions of taking down the site, CSV backups are HIGHLY encouraged.

Shoot for the stars, hit the moon. But before you take off, check that blood sugar!
